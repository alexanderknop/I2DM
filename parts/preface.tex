If you are reading this book, you probably have never studied proofs before.
So let me give you some advice: mathematical books are very different from
fiction, and even books in other sciences. Quite often you may see that some
steps are missing, and some steps are not really explained and just claimed as
obvious. The main reason behind this is to make the ideas of the proof more
visible and to allow grasping the essence of proofs quickly.

Since the steps are skipped, you cannot just read the book and believe that you
studied the topic; the best way to actually study the topic is to try to prove
every statement before you read the actual proof in the book. In addition to
this, I recommend trying to solve all the exercises in the book (you may find
exercises in the middle and at the end of every chapter).

Additionally, many topics in this book have a corresponding five-minute video
explaining the material of the chapter, it is useful to watch them before you go
into the topic.

\section*{Organization}
Part~1 covers the basics of mathematics and provide the language we use in the
next parts. We start from the explanation of what a mathematical proof is (in
Chapter~1). Chapter~2 shows how to prove theorems indirectly using proof by 
contradiction. Chapter~3 explains the most powerful method in our disposal,
proof by induction. Finally, Chapters 4-7 define several important objects such
as sets, functions, and relations.
